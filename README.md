# ice_core-image_processing
Code for pre-processing of Ice Core line scan images and quantification of Melt Proportions

I am working on a detailed manual for the script. In the meantime, if you need any help with running the scripts or find any bug (99% chance that you definetely will), fell free to get in touch with me at rdey180@gmail.com.

I am also planning on shifting to a open source language (Julia or Python) and will add the scripts to this same repository. But that might take some time, so I would be happy to help with the analyses if you don't have access to MATLAB.
